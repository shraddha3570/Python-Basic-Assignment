2. What is the difference between string and variable?

Answer:  A variable is a “place” where you can store any of these types of values, but is not in itself a value.
         Strings are an ordered collection or sequence of characters.
         A variable can hold a string, but a string can't hold a variable
        We cannot use space or “” & ‘’ while specifying the Variable and in string we have to use “” & ‘’
```

3. Describe three different data types.

Answer: 1. Numeric:  Numeric data type represent the data which has numeric value. 
        Numeric value can be integer, floating number or even complex numbers. 
        These values are defined as int, float and complex class in Python.
Eg:Numeric = 67, 6.78, 3+2j


2. List :  List is a collection of things, enclosed in [ ] and separated by commas
    and A single list may contain DataTypes like Integers, Strings, as well as Objects.
    Lists are mutable and hence they can be altered even after their creation.
Eg : list = ['xyz', 123, 7.1, 'hello' ]


3. Dictionary:  Dictionaries stores data in key-value pairs.
    The key values are usually strings, and the value can be of any data type. 
    The key-value pairs are enclosed with curly braces ({}). 
    Each key-value pair is separated from the other using a colon (:) and their values can be changed after creating it.
Eg: a={"animal":"cat","bird":"sparrow"}
```

10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'

Answer: 99 in an integer so it cannot be concatenated with the other string data types 
    so we have to convert 99 into string by adding str(99)

```
