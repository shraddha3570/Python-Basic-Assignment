14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?
Answer: The code that could cause an error goes in the try clause.
    The code that executes if an error happens goes in the except clause.First, try clause is executed it means the 
    code between try and except clause. If there is no exception, then only try clause will run, except clause is finished.
    If any exception occured, try clause will be skipped and except clause will run.
